		<h2>The Lighthouse Advantage</h2>
		<p>
			Investors need a capital source that is flexible and proactive in overcoming the obstacles associated 
			with our economyâ€™s volatile credit markets. Establishing a relationship with multiple financing institutions 
			is critical to ensure the long-term success of your investment portfolio. Too many investors have discovered 
			the high costs incurred when their source of capital dries up. As they scramble to find a new lender, many of 
			these investors are forced to sell their assets quickly or refinance on unfavorable terms. It can be difficult 
			and time consuming to continually locate lenders that are comfortable financing the various property types and 
			locations that most investors are seeking. How do you know you are getting the best terms available?
